- 👋 Hi, I’m @dataminer-x, but I also use Superfly Samurai on some platforms. 
- 👀 I’m interested in wrangling data to make stuff that solves problems and answers questions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning kotlin because I wrote a [Spotify playlist creator](https://github.com/me50/dataminer-x) on Python3 for CS50P and I want to build an app
 as a next step.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment.
- 📫 You can reach me on the Fediverse: https://hachyderm.io/@SuperflySamurai
